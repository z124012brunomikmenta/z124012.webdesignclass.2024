            <h2>Hiroshima:</h2>
            <p class="description">I stayed only one day and two nights in Hiroshima. Despite this, it was a very busy stay and I was able
                to visit various cool places, like the <strong>Genbaku Dome</strong>, the <strong>Peace Memorial Museum</strong>,
                <strong>Miyajima Island</strong> and the famous <strong>Itsukushima Shrine</strong>. Unfortunately, the weather was 
                pretty bad that day, but it was still very enjoyable. I also ate a Hiroshima's traditional <i>Okonomiyaki</i> and at
                night relaxed in the big <i>onsen</i> at the hotel.

            <h2>Kyoto:</h2>
            <p class="description">I stayed two days and three nights at Kyoto. Every place was unbelievably crowded by turists.
                Some of the most memorable places I went to were the <strong>Nishiki market</strong>, <strong>Fushimi Inari-taisha</strong>
                and <strong>Kiyomizu-dera temple</strong>.</p><figure id="imgSD">

            <h2>Mount Fuji:</h2>
            <p class="description">When I came back to Tokyo at the end of the Golden Week, I went on a bus tour to visit multiple
            famous spots where you can take pictures of Mount Fuji, like <strong>Arakurayama Sengen Park</strong>, for example.
            The weather was clear and perfect for taking photos.</p>
